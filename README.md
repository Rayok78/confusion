CONFUSION
=========

An easy-to-use system for confidential messaging

## Installation

This program is written in Ruby and requires you install Ruby first. We'd like
to fix that!

For now you will need to use one of the following methods to install Ruby:

* **Windows**: [RubyInstaller](http://rubyinstaller.org/)
* **Mac or Linux***: [RVM](https://rvm.io/)
* **Mac or Linux***: [chruby](https://github.com/postmodern/chruby)
* **Java**: [JRuby](http://www.jruby.org/download)

Once you've installed Ruby you can install `confusion` with:

```
gem install confusion
``` 

## Usage

Coming soon!
